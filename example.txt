# List of teams
# The number on the left, before the colon, must be unique in this file, but numbers may be
# omitted.
# <team name> is a human readable name, output in that mode
# <venue name> is the `Short Code` for the team in League Republic

# When fixtures happen. Lines must start with `week` (case insensitive) followed by a
# monotonically incrementing number.
#
# If you wish two sets of fixtures on the same date, use that same date on two consecutive
# 'weeks'
#
# Hopefully obviously, if you want calendar weeks off, simply omit them and use WeekN+1
# for the next calendar match. For (real) example, 21/22 Christmas with our matches on Thursdays:
# Week14:09/12/2021
# Week15:16/12/2021
#  <xmas/new year here>
# Week16:06/01/2022 # NOT week 18.
# Week17:20/01/2022
#
# Not monotonically incrementing the Week# number will result in fixture sets for those missing
# being omitted.
Week1:dd/mm/yyy
Week2:dd/mm/yyy
